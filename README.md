# PHASE 2 - WEEK 2 - CODE CHALLENGE

# Bot Battlr

A website demo of components, props, state, events, and data fetching in react.

A galactic overlord has hired you to build a galactic web app that will allow them to browse through a list of robots, view a robot's details, and, enlist a bot into their army. Actions available:

- See profiles of all bots rendered in `BotCollection`.
- Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it. The selected bot should
 render in the `YourBotArmy` component. The bot can be enlisted only **once**.
The bot **does not** disappear from the `BotCollection`.
- Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the
 `YourBotArmy` component.
- Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked
 "x", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the
 `YourBotArmy` on the frontend.
